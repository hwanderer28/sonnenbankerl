this is a list of things that need to be improved in the flutter app. it is mainly about design. you might want to look at @frontend/ for reference

- [x] so we have this clustering algorithm of the datapoints. right now the colour scheming is not very nice, as a cluster shows in yellow, which might be confused with the yellow of an actual exposed bench. so the cluster colour should be more neutral.
- [x] next up we have the bench details. right now this is very minmal in the flutter app. in the web frontend we are showing some more detail there. please add those details but remain the styling of the flutter app (especially those emoticons)
- [x] also what you will see in the webapp is a topbar with current time and date and some summary of the bench data. add this to the flutter app in a beautiful manner
